# Project1


## Description

Our project is designed so that a user, uncertain about whether or not a movie they've heard about is worth the watch, can enter in the movie title and with one click of a button be given a list of the movie's main cast members, it's IMDB rating, a list of awards its won, several of its poster images, and trailers for the movie found on YouTube. The user is also given the option to click a button clear their results, and to press a button that re-populates the page with the results of their last search.

This project was accomplished by using fetch calls to the IMDB API database to retrieve information about a movie's cast, awards, and posters, and fetch calls to the YouTube API database to retrieve movie trailers.

## Usage

To search up a movie, enter the movie's title in the search bar, and click "Search." Information about the movie's cast, awards, posters, and embedded YouTube movie trailers will then populate the empty cards on the webpage. The user then only has to look at the information provided, and press the "play" button on a youtube trailer to watch it.

To clear results, press the "Clear Results" button.

To re-populate the webpage with information from your last search, press the "Last Search" button.

## Direction for future development
